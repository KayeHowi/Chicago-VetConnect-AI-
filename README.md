# Chicago VetConnect AI (Version 1)
AI powered resource assistant helping Chicago military veterans quickly find housing, healthcare, and support services within Chicago and the Greater Chicago area. 

This project uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide grounded answers based on verified documents from local and federal veteran support organizations. 

Crisis awareness and minimized hallucination risk are the key safety consideratons of this project. 

PROBLEM: 
Navigating veteran services can be confusing and time sensitive. Incorrect or outdated information can cause serious harm, especially for individuals experiencing housing instability. 
Chicago VetConnect AI was designed from a user first perspective, priortizing:
- accuracy
- citations
- crisis awareness
- minimal hallucination risk

FEATURES: 
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Vector searh with ChromaDB
- local embeddings 
- Crisis phrase detection and emergency guidance
- Source citations 
- FastAPI backend
- Groq powered LLM responses

Stack:
- Python
- FastAPI
- Langchain
- ChromaDB
- Groq LLM API
- Ollama (local models)

SETUP:
Clone the repo: 
git clone https://github.com/KayeHowi/Chicago-VetConnect-AI
cd chicago_vetconnect_ai

Create environment:
python -m venv venv 
venv\Scripts\activate

Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Create the .env file (you will need your own Groq API key. Get it from Groq.com)
groq_api_key=your_api_key_here

Ingest documents:
python src/ingest.py

Run server:
uvicorn src.main.app --reload

Open: 
http://127.0.0.1:8000

Then ask your question and get a response. 

SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:
This system minimizes hallucinations risk by:
- Using retrieval augmented generation
- Restricting responses to document context
- Providing citations
- Including crisis detection safeguards 

Upcoming Updates (version 2):
- Add additional Chicago area veteran resource documents
- Improve retrieval ranking
- Add conversation memory
- Deploy production demo
- Improve crisis detection and response 

Goal: 
This project is designed to provide reliable access to critical information for veterans experiencing homelessness or are facing housing insecurity in Chicago. 
The assistant draws on collected information to provide information at a person's time of greatest need-the loss of basic human needs. 
It prioritizes accuracy, concise responses and verified sources to reduce the risk of misinformation.
